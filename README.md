# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Assets

Placeholder images for the wireframe screen are stored in `public/wireframe/`.


## SEO & Performance

This project includes lightweight, dependency-free utilities to improve SEO and Core Web Vitals.

- Head management (client-side): use the SEOHead component to set title, lang, canonical, robots, and OG/Twitter meta.
  Example:
  
  ```tsx
  <SEOHead title="Deepbird â€” Portfolio et services web" description="Portfolio, projets et services web." canonical="https://portfolio.deepbird.fr/"></SEOHead>
  ```

- JSON-LD: add structured data with the JsonLd component.
  Example:
  
  ```tsx
  <JsonLd data={{ "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "WebSite", name: "Deepbird", url: "https://portfolio.deepbird.fr/" }} />
  ```

- SEO helpers: src/utils/seo.ts provides buildCanonical, buildTitle, and defaultSEO helpers used by SEOHead.

- Routing & Errors: the app now uses react-router-dom with a Home route (/) and a NotFound (/*) page, and wraps the app with an ErrorBoundary for graceful fallback UI.

- Web Vitals: minimal reporting via PerformanceObserver is started from src/main.tsx (reportWebVitals), logging LCP/CLS/FCP/INP to the console by default.

Note on SSR: no SSR server is included yet, but the SEO components/utilities are SSR-friendly and can be reused in a future SSR setup.
